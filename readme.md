# Assignment 01 - Part 2: Git Refresher

(Continued from the assignment 01 page)

Next you will re-familiarize yourself (or simply demonstrate your familiarity) with the ways and goings-ons of using git, specifically git in the context of public github accounts. As you have no doubt experienced in your other courses, git is an essential skill for managing code. Proper git usage will be critical in this course as well, as we will be creating visualizations that are displayed publicly on the internet that will be mounted on github. If you are not familiar with it there are lots of resources all over the internet that will help you get oriented.

1. Make sure you have a Github account.
2. Fork this REPO from your own account.
3. Add your name and github ID to the list of names and github ids in the readme.md file.
4. Make a pull request against the original repo
